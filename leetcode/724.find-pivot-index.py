#
# Given an array of integers nums, write a method that returns the "pivot"
# index of this array.
# 
# We define the pivot index as the index where the sum of the numbers to the
# left of the index is equal to the sum of the numbers to the right of the
# index.
# 
# If no such index exists, we should return -1. If there are multiple pivot
# indexes, you should return the left-most pivot index.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 
# nums = [1, 7, 3, 6, 5, 6]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 
# The sum of the numbers to the left of index 3 (nums[3] = 6) is equal to the
# sum of numbers to the right of index 3.
# Also, 3 is the first index where this occurs.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: 
# nums = [1, 2, 3]
# Output: -1
# Explanation: 
# There is no index that satisfies the conditions in the problem
# statement.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The length of nums will be in the range [0, 10000].
# Each element nums[i] will be an integer in the range [-1000, 1000].

class Solution:
    def pivotIndex(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return -1
        nums = [0]+nums+[0]
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(1,n-1):
            if sum(nums[:i])==sum(nums[i+1:]):
                return i-1
        return -1
