#
# Implement int sqrt(int x).
# 
# Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a
# non-negative integer.
# 
# Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and
# only the integer part of the result is returned.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 4
# Output: 2
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: 8
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
# the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
