#
# 
# An image is represented by a 2-D array of integers, each integer representing
# the pixel value of the image (from 0 to 65535).
# 
# Given a coordinate (sr, sc) representing the starting pixel (row and column)
# of the flood fill, and a pixel value newColor, "flood fill" the image.
# 
# To perform a "flood fill", consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels
# connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the
# starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels
# (also with the same color as the starting pixel), and so on.  Replace the
# color of all of the aforementioned pixels with the newColor.
# 
# At the end, return the modified image.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: 
# image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
# sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2
# Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
# Explanation: 
# From the center of the image (with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1)), all pixels
# connected 
# by a path of the same color as the starting pixel are colored with the new
# color.
# Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally
# connected
# to the starting pixel.
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# The length of image and image[0] will be in the range [1, 50].
# The given starting pixel will satisfy 0  and 0 .
# The value of each color in image[i][j] and newColor will be an integer in [0,
# 65535].

class Solution:
    def floodFill(self, image: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, newColor: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        cur,image[sr][sc]=image[sr][sc],newColor
        if cur==newColor:
            return image
        locs=[(sr,sc)]
        m,n = len(image),len(image[0])
        while locs:
            a,b = locs[0]
            for nb in [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]:
                nbr,nbc = nb
                nbr+=a
                nbc+=b
                if 0<=nbr<m and 0<=nbc<n and image[nbr][nbc]==cur:
                    locs.append((nbr,nbc))
                    image[nbr][nbc]=newColor
            locs.pop(0)
        return image
